* around a billion malnourished people
  * moral disaster
  * ecological catastrophe
* hunger kills more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined
* 1/3 of food is wasted globally
  * up to 50% in some estimates
  * enough to feed all
  * we've built a supply chain that maximises profit and normalizes waste
  * subsistence farmers and households in sub-Saharan Africa waste almost nothing
* why is food wasted?
  * apples that aren't round enough
  * a box of eggs thrown out because one has broken
  * contracts that need supplies overproduction
  * the packaging has broken
  * the label is printed wrong
* huge emissions of greenhouse gases
  * impact production + landfill is massive.
  * if it were a country ...

???

* also
  * a quarter of all freshwater consumption
  * land use = China and the EU combined
  * more economic development more consumer waste

* so, how do we solve it?

# [Inter]Government organisations

* now recognised at high levels
* approach: target &rarr; measure &rarr; act
* UN Sustainable Development Goal 12.3
> "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses"


--

## ... but

* get stuck trying to measure?
* too many working groups, committees, reports, not enough tangible change
* need people and organisations

???

* now recognised at high levels
  * last 10 years recognized the problem UN, EU
  * 10s if not 100s of millions of euros into it
* target measure act
* SDG 12.3

but
* get stuck trying to measure?
  * linear approach
  * what does food or waste even mean
  * UN speech "The first reporting by Member States is foreseen in 2022."
  * 7 years to report, how long before we act?
* EU and UN reports
  * policies, tools, reports
  * little tangible impact
  * underfunded
* need people and organisations
  * 2016 france outlawed food waste, but lacks infrastructure to collect it
  * not solved from an office

# Big Charity

* there to fix state/market problems
* collect food and redirect to food banks and community cafes,

## ... but

* now intertwined with state and market
* stigma of living from charity
* short term measures of impact miss the point

???

* there to fix state/market problems
  * fix the problems the state or market can't or won't
  * seems perfect for food waste
* collect food and redirect to food banks and community cafes
  * professional food handlers, regulated and trained

... but
* now intertwined with state and market
  * recent report about state of civil society
    * "charities are seen to have become part of the very system they were set up to challenge"
  * grants -> contracts
  * UK: laws setup to prevent criticism of the government
  * accountable to their funders, not people and communities
* stigma of living from charity
  * want: dignity, independence, empowerment
  * netherlands study food bank emotions:
    * appreciated food but
    * the shame of being "bottom of the social hierarchy"
* short term measures of impact miss the point
  * "size, turnover and short-term measures of impact"
  * long term "connections with people and communities... everyone involved to have some power"
  * sister 30+ years, laughed at recommenations, seen reports like this 

* look beyond charity sector, see private sector

# Startups

* food waste costs €143 billion in EU alone
* startup model: venture capital, lots of users, business model
* business models: charge to collect waste, sell food, advertising/promotions

--

## ... but

* real mission: profit
* exploitative labour

???

* food waste costs €143 billion in EU alone
* startup model: venture capital, lots of users, business model
  * 10s of millions in funding to do this
  * profit
* business models: charge to collect waste, sell food, advertising/promotions
  * models:
    * charge to collect
    * let them sell + commission
    * advertising, promotions

... but

* real mission: profit
  * fighting food waste, saving the environment, making the world a better place
  * profit for founders and investors
  * good intent, but... when it comes to it
* exploitative labour
  * rely on huge network of people, users volunteers
  * no control, ownership, profits extracted back to investors
  * real heart of the business locked away from scrutiny 

What's left? resilient communities...

# A task for the community

* part of a wider change for civil society
> "a radical and creative shift that puts power in the hands of people and communities, preventing an ‘us and them’ future, connecting us better and humanising the way we do things."<br>
> "not waiting for permission, or hoping others will provide a plan"
* democratic and participatory
* the world is in our hands
  * community and activist groups
  * solidarity economies
  * transition towns
  * co-operatives

???

* part of a wider change for civil society
  * food waste not isolated problem
  * Civil Society Futures report
* democratic and participatory 
  * people are involved
  * have control of tools, software
  * share power
  * move away from social hierarchy, no us and them
  * active not passive consumers
* the world is in our hands
  * as seen, nobody is coming
  * systems and structures fail us
  * we can use/learn from:
    * community and activist groups
    * solidarity economies
    * transition towns
    * co-operatives
  * empower ourselves to act, don't take 7 years

Let's see how these ideas apply to saving food.

???
- one solution already in place is foodsharing.de
- biggest volunteer-based foodsaving initiative there is
- some idealist dumpster diver 7 years ago
- absurd to rummage through trash to then find so much edible food that it's possible to live off it exclusively
- approached store owners, found some who agreed that it's a shame
- agreed on fixed times at which volunteers could pick up the surplus
- soon there were more stores, more volunteers
- distribution needed, because foodsavers themselves couldn't eat it all
- it all got quite complex pretty fast
- so a foodsaver who happened to be a developer created an online platform
- to help with the organizational bits

---

# foodsharing.de · Figures

- 50.000 foodsavers
- 5.000 cooperating stores
- 600 publicly accessible food-share point
- a team of volunteer coders

???
- and today we have:
- 50.000 foodsavers
- 5.000 cooperating stores
- 600 publicly accessible food-share points
- a team of volunteer coders who keeps foodsharing.de running

# foodsharing.de · Golden rules

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsGoldenRules.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- the golden rules are: (see slide)
- this means that the foodsavers themselves can decide what to do with the saved food as long as it's gonna be eaten
- simple, positive, direct and empowering
- it's just natural to spread it further and further
- It already grew beyond the borders of Germany years ago
- nowadays extends more and more into areas where no German is spoken
- foodsharing.de - which is available in German only - cannot be used there
- but really, you don't need software to get started


---

# What software doesn't do

<div class="grid-container">
  <img src="./images/computerPersonText.jpg" width="460"/>
  <b style="margin-top: 200px">vs.</b>
  <img src="./images/nyamatraddareText.jpg" width="460"/>
</div>

???
- cause what software doesn't do is,
- it's not gonna transform a lonely computer person into part of an active real-life community
- software doesn't build a physical network of people for you
- what's needed is some time, some ideas and some determination to make this work
- get off your chair and out into the real world
- talk to people about food waste, form a first small group of like-minded individuals and gather the courage to contact stores at eye level
- may not be the easiest thing, but can theoretically be started tomorrow
- no need to ask someone for permission
- you can just take matters into your own hands and get active!
- but you don't need to get active alone...

---

# Yay community! :D

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmoscow_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- in fact, you need people coming together for this to work
- in the end you need a whole community of foodsavers and eaters to make use of all the saved food
- so you want a good community spirit so that ppl want to come back
- and you want a core group of friends to coordinate everything
- cos everything is more fun if you do it together with friends
- and what is more fun is more stable, because you _like_ doing it

---

# How to find friends

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmaastricht_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- so how to find this core group of friends? How do people become friends?
- getting to know each other, spending time together and finding out to have something in common
- foodsaving offers all this through a common goal and a plan!
- Start with info events and communal cooking to spread the word, continue with building FSPs and cooperations
- for starters core group of maybe 5 foodsavers is more than enough
- if everyone is a bit open and friendly you will most definitely get along
- the more time you spend, the stronger your bond will grow
- So many things you can - and should! - do:
- Hangouts, brunches, communal cooking, movie screenings
- activities that are fun _and_ pr at the same time

---

# With a core group...

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/discosoupQuito.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- everything's gonna be much easier
- You can share workloads and develop plans together,
- you can exchange ideas and form synergies,
- you can save food and have a jolly good time while at it.
- Foodsaving becomes a hobby and a lifestyle, something you just _do_
- underlying environmental and social reasons create a culture that can more easily spread and maintains itself
- Leads to more people feeling motivated and empowered to get further involved
- Leads to even more possible growth via more pr: info stands, distribution events, festival participation

---

# Catalyst effect

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/getGoingTogetherText.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- Food waste is just one of many issues in this absurd world we live in today
- When people become foodsavers, they're normally interested in making the world a better place,
- when they participate for a while, they learn that they actually _can_ make a change
- positive, productive and practical environmental activists
- many similar topics in the sense of zero waste, upcycling, repairing and general environmentalism become obvious
- so do the many more similar forms of countering these, like:
  - Organizing free shops and free markets, clothes sharing parties, repair cafes, skill sharing sessions, etc.

---

# Internalization

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/lifestyleOfShaving.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- by living this logic for a while people's view of the world can change
- they might start basing their actions on these three values:

- 'use what's already there'
  - get active to find it, to understand it, to make it accessible and useful again
- 'share what you don't immediately need'
  - regain control over your desires, conquer your greed, understand that you are not your possessions
- 'live by your own standards'
  - reject normality as a value in itself, form independent opinions

- This is basically the description of an eco hacker, don't you agree?
- So how does it work to spread this mindset?

# User story:<br>foodsharing Östersund

<div class="grid-container">
  <img src="./images/TeddyFlight.jpg" height="400"/>
  <div style="margin-top: 140px">Some months later:</div>
  <img src="./images/teddyIca.jpg" height="400"/>
</div>

???
- Normally it goes somewhat like this:
- Teddy from Germany is a very active foodsaver going to Sweden for her studies
- She wants to spread the idea of foodsaving in her new city Östersund (50k inhabitants)
- She holds two info events to gather like-minded people, where only 4-6 people show up
- She creates two facebook groups to gather interested people and fellow foodsavers respectively
- She contacts stores to build up cooperations
- She contacts us and asks for help setting up a group on Karrot
- our pickup management tool Tilmann will tell you more about in a second
- Over the coming months a community forms, more cooperations are built and lots of food is saved
- In three weeks Teddy will leave Östersund because her study time there is over, but look what she leaves behind:
- there were 2 newspaper articles
- participation in at least 4 public events
- 5 cooperating stores, 2 of which are supermarkets
- a public fsp with fridge
- a hangout for the community twice a month
- 600kg of food was saved
- 200 foodsavers in the Karrot group

# Karrot

Our foodsaving tool and community organizer!

<div align="center">
  <img height="350" src="./images/karrot-big.png">

</div>

???
Karrot is our contribution to help foodsaving groups grow.
It's a web app that gives each group their own space for organizing.
We have desktop and mobile versions, because we are often on the road when we save food.

In one sentence: think of it as a combination of a collaborative calender and a messaging system.

Now let's look a bit deeper what we can do on Karrot.

---
background-color: black
background-image: url(images/karrotost.png)
background-size: 90%

???
First, someone will create a group. Here's how the group start screen looks.
Then, they enter details about their co-operations, where and when they happen, if they happen regularly, how many people are needed and so on.

There's a list of food pickups and people can sign up for them.
As you can see here, all slots are already filled, which is very good!

We can also write messages to the whole group, to individual users or to those we do food pickups together with.

After doing the food pickup, we can give feedback how it went and how many kilos we saved.
This helps to spread information amongst team members.
We also get meaningful statistics.

To grow our group, we can invite others via email or let them apply for the group.
We can chat with them and invite them for a meeting in real-life before we accept them into the group.

# Karrot · Our goals

- serve many groups in different countries
- encourage do-ocratic participation
- let people work together

???
"Why is Karrot the way it is?"

When we work on Karrot development, our search for the best solution is guided by these goals.

We want to provide useful software for multiple groups which are different in many ways.
They come from different countries and have different rules, different language.

We want to encourage participation in groups, from all members.
Our model for this is "do-ocracy":
do something if you think it should be done and be excellent to each other.

We want to let people work together.
Our assumption is that people want to work together to make something great.
We want to make sure they can do that and no getting interrupted by destructive actions.

# Example: Group membership

<div class="center" style="padding-top: 40px">
  <img height="400px" src="./images/karrot-trust.svg" />
</div>

???

"what's an example of the special karrot way?"

There are many design decisions in Karrot that I would like to talk about.
But there's not enough time in this talk, so I will just highlight one topic.
The group membership progress.

- you apply to join group
- group members interview you
- (your accept rules, you come to a real-life meeting)
- group member accepts your application
- you are newcomer
- you do pickups, meet people, give feedback
- others trust you
- you gain editing rights
- you set up new co-operations and drive the group forward

Newcomers have only limited rights until they gained the trust of other group members.
Active long-term members should all become editors.

This design has been inspired by the trust level of the Discourse forum software.

# Karrot · Comparison

<div class="center">
  <img height="100px" src="images/foodsharing-logo-white.png" />
</div>

Karrot has:

- independent groups
- multi-language and localization
- self-managing trust-based hierarchy
- feedback about pickups


???

"isn't there other software that does the same thing?"

Karrot has drawn a number of inspirations from other software.
Our main inspiration was foodsharing.de, with its dense network of foodsharing groups in German-speaking regions.
We made significant modifications to adapt it for worldwide use:

First, all groups are independent from each other.
This allows them to set their own rules, because the social and legal context of every country is different.

We added localization support, so that groups can use Karrot in their own language and timezone.

We use a self-managing trust-based hierarchy instead of manually assigning admin roles.

We added a system to provide feedback about food pickups.

---

# Karrot · Development

- our users actively give feedback and help with setting priorities
- unfunded
- no one except the developers and the users have a say on what should be done
- supported by saved food and various hackbases (&rarr; Kanthaus)

???

"how did you achieve it?"

...

--

## In future

- groups to spend some of their funds on Karrot
- formalize cooperative structure for development and karrot.world

???

...

---

# Karrot · Progress

- started in 2016
- has active users since mid-2017
- currently 16 active groups in 9 countries with 500 active users
- 50 food pickups per day

???

"what is the current state of Karrot?"

--

500 users in two years?

&rarr; fail! - _if we were a startup..._

But: **these people go out and save food every day!**

???

Startup: move fast and break things
Resilience: move slow and make things

---

# Karrot · Generalization

We can do more than foodsaving:

- bike saving &rarr; _Bike kitchen_ movement
- wood saving
- fruit from trees
- elderly care
- child care

???

"Can other fields benefit from Karrot as well?"
