???

- distributing it unconditionally to whoever can make use of it
- grew big in German-speaking countries over the past 6 years
- 50k foodsavers, 5k cooperating stores of all sizes

# What software doesn't do

</div>

???
- Most work happens offline!
- You need to get out to find potential foodsavers
- You need to talk to establish cooperations with stores
- You need to get off your chair to actually do a pickup
- You need a physical network to distribute huge amounts of saved food

---

# Yay community! :D

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmoscow_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- You need people working together for this to function
- Everything is more fun if you do it together with friends
- What is more fun is more stable, as you'll keep on doing it

---

# How to find friends

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmaastricht_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- With a common goal and a plan!
- Just get out there and call for action, they'll show themselves!
- Start with info events and communal cooking to spread the word, continue with building FSPs and cooperations
- A core group of maybe 5 foodsavers is more than enough for starters.
- People need to get to know each other!
- Organize activities that are fun _and_ pr at the same time
- Hangouts, brunches, communal cooking, movie screenings

---

# With a core group...

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/discosoupQuito.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- Foodsaving becomes a hobby and a lifestyle
- Environmental and social reasons for foodsaving create a culture that can more easily spread and maintains itself
- More people feel motivated and empowered to get further involved
- More growth is possible: info stands, distribution events, festival participation

---

# Catalyst effect

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/getGoingTogetherText.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- People learn that they can actually make a change if they just go out and _do_ something
- As soon as you have a group of dedicated foodsavers who share the same ideals, you have a group of activists
- Many more similar topics in the sense of zero waste, upcycling, repairing and general environmentalism
- And many more similar forms of countering these:
  - Free shops and free markets, repair cafes, skill sharing sessions, etc.

---

# Internalization

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/lifestyleOfShaving.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- portmanteau of saving and sharing
- 'use what's already there'
  - get active to find it, to understand it, to make it accessible and useful again
- 'share what you don't immediately need'
  - regain control over your desires, conquer your greed, understand that you are not your possessions
- 'live by your own standards'
  - reject normality as a value in itself, form independent opinions

# Karrot · Comparison

Karrot has been derived from our experience with foodsharing.de, with these modifications:

- independent groups
- flexible system to accept new members and introduce them to the group
- better support for communication and notifications
- feedback about pickups
- multi-language and localization
- self-managing hierarchy with a trust system

hierachy

# No admin features?

- prevent malicious use
- stop abuse
- prevent mistakes by unexperienced users
- people are used to it from other software


Someone needs to set up everything and stay in control of it.
We still have server admins, but we want to minimize interventions as much as possible.

???
social control
people want to co-operate
prevent people from making mistakes
do not assume malicious use by default

easier to code

# Self-managing hierarchy

- trust system
- newcomer role
- group application chat
- activity log
- user removal through voting
- limit destructive actions

---

# Karrot · History

- started in 2016
- has active users since mid-2017
- currently 16 active groups in 9 countries with 500 active users
- 50 food pickups per day

--

500 users in two years?

&rarr; Failure! - _if we were a startup..._

But: **these people go out and save food every day!**

---

# Karrot · Development

- users suggest features and help with priorities
- unfunded
- supported by saved food and various hackbases (&rarr; Kanthaus)

???
we have users and they actively give feedback
only the users tell us what we should do (no funding requirements)

--

## In future

- groups to spend some of their funds on Karrot
- formalize cooperative structure for development and karrot.world

---

# Karrot · Generalization

We can do more than foodsaving:
- bike saving &rarr; _Bike kitchen_ movement
- wood saving
- fruit from trees
- elderly care
- child care
