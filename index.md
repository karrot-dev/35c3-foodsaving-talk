# What software doesn't do

</div>

???
- Most work happens offline!
- You need to get out to find potential foodsavers
- You need to talk to establish cooperations with stores
- You need to get off your chair to actually do a pickup
- You need a physical network to distribute huge amounts of saved food

---

# Yay community! :D

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmoscow_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- You need people working together for this to function
- Everything is more fun if you do it together with friends
- What is more fun is more stable, as you'll keep on doing it

---

# How to find friends

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmaastricht_team.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- With a common goal and a plan!
- Just get out there and call for action, they'll show themselves!
- Start with info events and communal cooking to spread the word, continue with building FSPs and cooperations
- A core group of maybe 5 foodsavers is more than enough for starters.
- People need to get to know each other!
- Organize activities that are fun _and_ pr at the same time
- Hangouts, brunches, communal cooking, movie screenings

---

# With a core group...

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/discosoupQuito.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- Foodsaving becomes a hobby and a lifestyle
- Environmental and social reasons for foodsaving create a culture that can more easily spread and maintains itself
- More people feel motivated and empowered to get further involved
- More growth is possible: info stands, distribution events, festival participation

---

# Catalyst effect

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/getGoingTogetherText.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- People learn that they can actually make a change if they just go out and _do_ something
- As soon as you have a group of dedicated foodsavers who share the same ideals, you have a group of activists
- Many more similar topics in the sense of zero waste, upcycling, repairing and general environmentalism
- And many more similar forms of countering these:
  - Free shops and free markets, repair cafes, skill sharing sessions, etc.

---

# Internalization

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/lifestyleOfShaving.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>

???
- portmanteau of saving and sharing
- 'use what's already there'
  - get active to find it, to understand it, to make it accessible and useful again
- 'share what you don't immediately need'
  - regain control over your desires, conquer your greed, understand that you are not your possessions
- 'live by your own standards'
  - reject normality as a value in itself, form independent opinions

# Karrot

Our foodsaving tool and community organizer...

Karrot is our contribution to help foodsaving groups grow.
It's a web app that gives each group their own space for organizing.
We have desktop and mobile versions, because we are often on the road when we save food.

In one sentence: think of it as a combination of a collaborative calender and a messaging system.

Now let's look a bit deeper what we do on Karrot.

???
First, someone will create a group. Here's how the group start screen looks.
Then, they enter details about their co-operations, where and when they happen, if they happen regularly, how many people are needed and so on.

There's a list of food pickups and people can sign up for them.
As you can see here, all slots are already filled, which is very good!

We can also write messages to the whole group, to individual users or to those we do food pickups together with.

After doing the food pickup, we can give feedback how it went and how many kilos we saved.
This helps to spread information amongst team members.
We also get meaningful statistics.

To grow our group, we can invite others via email or let them apply for the group.
We can chat with them and invite them for a meeting in real-life before we accept them into the group.

# Karrot · Comparison

<div class="center">
  <img height="100px" src="images/foodsharing-logo-white.png" />
</div>

- independent groups
- flexible system to accept new members and introduce them to the group
- better support for communication and notifications
- feedback about pickups
- multi-language and localization
- self-managing hierarchy with a trust system


???
Karrot has drawn a number of inspirations from other software.
Our main inspiration was foodsharing.de, with its dense network of foodsharing groups in German-speaking regions.
But we made significant modifications to adapt it for worldwide use:

First, all groups are independent.
This allows them to set their own rules, because the social and legal context of every country is different.

we added localization support

we got rid of the hierarchy.

---

# Karrot · No admin roles?

Yes, Karrot tries to organize groups without giving someone admin powers.

- people want to co-operate
- enable social control
- limit destructive actions
- trust needed for changing group settings

???
One decision that defines Karrot is how it handles admin tasks.
We did everything we could to prevent admin roles.
And it seems to work.

Our assumption is that people want to co-operate to make something great.
We added a history feature to log important actions and enable social control within the group.

We limit the amount of destructive actions that can be done.
No one can delete information, delete messages or remove users without involving others in the group.

Newcomers have only limited rights until they gained the trust of other group members.
All active members should grow out of the newcomer status at some point.

Of course, we still have server admins.
But we want to minimize interventions as much as possible and not let the admin roles creep down onto the users.

# Karrot · Self-managing hierarchy

- trust system
- newcomer role
- group application chat
- activity log
- user removal through voting
- limit destructive actions

???
should explain the trust system mentioned previous slide in more detail

# Karrot · History

- started in 2016
- has active users since mid-2017
- currently 16 active groups in 9 countries with 500 active users

--

500 users in two years?

&rarr; Failure! - _if we were a startup..._

But: **these people go out and save food every day!**

---

# Karrot · Development

- our users actively give feedback and help with setting priorities
- unfunded
- no one except the developers and the users have a say on what should be done
- supported by saved food and various hackbases (&rarr; Kanthaus)
