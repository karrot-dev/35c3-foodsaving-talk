# User story:<br>foodsharing Östersund

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="./images/TeddyFlight.jpg" height="400"/>
</div>

???
- Teddy from Germany is a very active foodsaver going to Sweden for her studies
- She wants to spread the idea of foodsaving in her new city Östersund (50k inhabitants)
- She holds two info events to gather like-minded people (only 4-6 people show up)
- She creates two facebook groups to gather interested people and fellow foodsavers respectively
- She contacts stores to build up cooperations
- She contacts us and asks for help setting up a group on Karrot
- As soon as the cooperations are established the stores and pickups are put up on Karrot and people can sign up there

# What Karrot doesn't do

???
- Most work happens offline!
- Karrot doesn't help you find potential foodsavers
- Karrot doesn't help you establish cooperations with stores
- Karrot doesn't help you get off your chair to actually do a pickup
- Karrot doesn't help you distribute huge amounts of saved food

# Yay community! :D

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmoscow_team.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

???
- You need people working together for this to function
- Everything is more fun if you do it together with friends
- What is more fun is more stable, as you'll keep on doing it

---

# How to find friends

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/fsmaastricht_team.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

???
- With a common goal and a plan!
- Just get out there and call for action, they'll show themselves!
- Start with info events and communal cooking to spread the word, continue with building FSPs and cooperations
- A core group of maybe 5 foodsavers is more than enough for starters.
- People need to get to know each other!
- Organize activities that are fun _and_ pr at the same time
- Hangouts, brunches, communal cooking, movie screenings

---

# With a core group...

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/discosoupQuito.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

???
- Foodsaving becomes a hobby and a lifestyle
- Environmental and social reasons for foodsaving create a culture that can more easily spread and maintains itself
- More people feel motivated and empowered to get further involved
- More growth is possible: info stands, distribution events, festival participation

---

# Catalyst effect

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/getGoingTogetherText.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

???
- People learn that they can actually make a change if they just go out and _do_ something
- As soon as you have a group of dedicated foodsavers who share the same ideals, you have a group of activists
- Many more similar topics in the sense of zero waste, upcycling, repairing and general environmentalism
- And many more similar forms of countering these:
  - Free shops and free markets, repair cafes, skill sharing sessions, etc.

# Internalization

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="./images/lifestyleOfShaving.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

???
- portmanteau of saving and sharing
- 'use what's already there'
  - get active to find it, to understand it, to make it accessible and useful again
- 'share what you don't immediately need'
  - regain control over your desires, conquer your greed, understand that you are not your possessions
- 'live by your own standards'
  - reject normality as a value in itself, form independent opinions
