# User story:<br>foodsharing Östersund

<div style="text-align: center">

???
- Teddy from Germany is a very active foodsaver going to Sweden for her studies
- She wants to spread the idea of foodsaving in her new city Östersund (50k inhabitants)
- She holds two info events to gather like-minded people (only 4-6 people show up)
- She creates two facebook groups to gather interested people and fellow foodsavers respectively
- She contacts stores to build up cooperations
- She contacts us and asks for help setting up a group on Karrot
- As soon as the cooperations are established the stores and pickups are put up on Karrot and people can sign up there

???
- Most work happens offline!
- Karrot doesn't help you find potential foodsavers
- Karrot doesn't help you establish cooperations with stores
- Karrot doesn't help you get off your chair to actually do a pickup
- Karrot doesn't help you distribute huge amounts of saved food

# Yay community! :D

???
- You need people working together for this to function
- Everything is more fun if you do it together with friends
- What is more fun is more durable, as you'll keep on doing it
