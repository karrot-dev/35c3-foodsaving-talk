Karrot is our contribution to help foodsaving groups grow.
Here is how it looks.

What are people doing on Karrot?

# Karrot · Comparison

Karrot has been derived from our experience with foodsharing.de, with these modifications:

- independent groups
- self-managing hierarchy with a trust system
- flexible system to accept new members and introduce them to the group
- better support for communication and notifications
- feedback about pickups
- multi-language and localization

---

# No admin features?

- prevent malicious use
- stop abuse
- prevent mistakes by unexperienced users
- people are used to it from other software


Someone needs to set up everything and stay in control of it.
We still have server admins, but we want to minimize interventions as much as possible.

exclude: true

# Classic corporate hierarchy

- boss
- team lead
- workers

Most software copies this hierarchy and makes it stricter

- admin
- moderators
- users

---
exclude: true

# It seems to work well, but there are downsides

- who controls your boss?
- when to get a promotion?
- how to get the users active?

Karrot is about getting users active.
Groups need people that take initiative.
Strict hierarchical roles stifle contributions.

---

# Karrot · History

- started in 2016
- has active users since mid-2017
- currently 16 active groups in 9 countries with 500 active users
- 50 food pickups per day

&rarr; _"failure!"_ - if we were a startup

But: **these people go out and save food every day!**

---

# Karrot · Development

- driven by experience from foodsharing.de
- users suggest features and help with priorities
- unfunded
- supported by saved food and various hackbases (-> Kanthaus)

--

## Karrot · Future

- add feature to remove users from groups
- improve self-managing hierarchy
- better communication features
- groups spend some of their funds on Karrot
- formalize cooperative structure for development and karrot.world
- more than foodsaving:
  - bike saving
  - wood saving
  - fruit from trees
  - elderly care
  - child care
