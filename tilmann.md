# Classic corporate hierarchy

- boss
- team lead
- workers

Most software copies this hierarchy and makes it stricter

- admin
- moderators
- users

---

# It seems to work well, but there are downsides

- who controls your boss?
- when to get a promotion?
- how to get the users active?

Karrot is about getting users active.
Groups need people that take initiative.
Strict hierarchical roles stiffle contributions.

# Karrot has been derived from our experience with foodsharing.de

This is how karrot improves on the foodsharing concept:

- independent groups

- self-managing hierarchy with a trust system

- flexible system to accept new members and introduce them to the group

- better support for communication and notifications

- feedback about pickups

- multi-language and localization

---

# What are people doing on Karrot?

- create a group
- create a store (place)
- set up one-time and recurring pickups
- write messages
- invite users
- accept/decline applications to join

- apply to join a group
- sign up for food pickups
- give feedback about pickups

---

# Why have admin features?

- prevent malicious use
- stop abuse
- prevent mistakes by unexperienced users
- people are used to it from other software


Somebody needs to set up everything and stay in control of it.
We still have server admins, but we want to minimize interventions as much as possible.

&rarr; _"failure!"_ - if we were a startup

But: **these people go out and save food every day!**

---

# Karrot Development

- driven by experience from foodsharing.de
- users suggest features and help with priorities
- unfunded
- supported by saved food and various hackbases (-> Kanthaus)

## Future
- groups spend some of their funds on Karrot
- formalize cooperative structure for development and karrot.world

---

# Karrot outlook

- add feature to remove users from groups
- improve self-managing hierarchy
- better communication features
- more than foodsaving:
  - bike saving
  - wood saving
  - fruit from trees
  - elderly care
  - child care
